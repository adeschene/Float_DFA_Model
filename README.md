# Float_DFA_Model
A model of the floating point number representation using a Deterministic Finite Automaton

Floating_pt_DFA.cpp is the source file. Once the program is executed, it will prompt for an input file. This input file must be in the same directory as the source file, and must contain strings, separated by newline characters. Each string will be tested against the DFA in turn, and the output will describe whether or not each string meets the criteria to be considered a floating point number, as it is defined in the C langauge.

fpNumbers.txt is a sample input text file for use with the program. It can be used as-is, modified, or a different file of the same structure can be created and used in its place.
